            <xhtml:p>This element is modified by one attribute, &quot;direct.&quot; The attribute options are yes (y), no (n), or unspecified (unspecified). These govern whether the quote will be represented with single or double quotes.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Question: Do I need to use a quote element everytime I want to use quotation marks? Answer: Yes and no. You should not enter quotation marks in your documents whatsoever. Quotation marks will be supplied by the system for the quote element as well as for a few other elements such as analytic titles and words appearing in the socalled element. The following is a brief summary of practice around the proper use of the quote element. Each issue listed here is discussed in detail with examples below.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
                <xhtml:li>A bibCit must follow every quote tag in bio and writing docs</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>A bibCit is optional following a quote tag in events</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>Periods and commas should be placed inside the quote tag</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>bibCits following quotes should be spaced as if they were not part of the document</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>a person quoted from a source that she/he did not author must be referred to as "qtd. in" in the bibCit attributes</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>the direct attribute on quote should be filled in to &quot;y&quot; unless one quote tag is embedded inside another at which point the outer tag would be DIRECT=&quot;y&quot; and the inner tag would be DIRECT=&quot;n&quot;</xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:li>page numbers in bibCits should not repeat numbers (e.g. 65-6 NOT 65-66)</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>See also &quot;soCalled.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Quotes and BibCits:All quote tags in bio/writing docs should be followed by a bibCit as if the sentence had normal spacing without the bibCit. The bibCit following a quote is optional in events, but it must be present at the level of the event.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It was originally opened by Queen Victoria as the People&apos;s Palace, a place of &lt;quote Direct=y&gt;rational and instructive entertainment and of artistic enjoyment&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;bibcit&gt;Harte 174&lt;/bibcit&gt;for the people of East London.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Note: There is no space between the end of the quote and the beginning of the bibCit, but there is a space after the bibCit before the following word. For issues of punctuation other than commas, consult Jeanne Wood.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Unless: If a single source is quoted multiple times in one sentence, the bibCit should immediately follow the end of the sentence.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Linking alcohol to higher incidents of domestic abuse and violence, LA goes on to describe how the law favours men and disfavours women. She details two points on which &lt;QUOTE DIRECT=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;laws bear hard on women.&lt;/QUOTE&gt;&lt;BIBCIT Qtd. in = QtdInYes&gt; Le Breton 368-9&lt;/BIBCIT&gt; The first concerns the &lt;QUOTE DIRECT=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;want of a stricter hand against the inveiglers of girls for wicked purposes&lt;/QUOTE&gt;; the second deplores a man&apos;s right to child custody when his &lt;QUOTE DIRECT=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;offences have compelled an innocent wife to obtain a divorce from him.&lt;/QUOTE&gt;&lt;BIBCITqtd. in= QtdInYes&gt; Le Breton 368-9&lt;/BIBCIT&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If a person other than the author of the work cited in the bibCit is quoted then use the QtdInYes value on the attribute &quot;qtd. in&quot; found on the bibCit element.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>According to literary historian Chris Baldick, &lt;QUOTE DIRECT=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;Maurice&apos;s own hope was that through the college&apos;s work, &lt;QUOTE DIRECT=&quot;N&quot;&gt;class may be united to class, not by necessity only, but by generous duties and common sympathies.&lt;/QUOTE&gt;&lt;/QUOTE&gt;&lt;BIBCIT&gt;Baldick 63&lt;/BIBCIT&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The direct attribute should only be set to no when you have placed one quote tag inside another. The inner of the two quote tags would be indirect. All other uses of the quote tag should have the direct attribute set to yes.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Each quote should have the direct attribute filled in.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Spacing should read properly when the bibCit is removed.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>There are two attributes on biography which ask you to identify the sex and the country of origin for the kind of person who is the subject of your biography document. The sex attribute has values for female, male, transgendered, and unknown. Transgendered should be used only when the subject of the biography identifies as such, and is defined in the following way: someone whose gender identity differs from their physical sex as assigned at birth. They include include pre-operative and post-operative transsexuals; transgenderists (persons living full-time in a gender opposite their birth sex with no desire to pursue surgery); transvestites (preferred term: cross-dressers, those whose gender expression occasionally differs from their birth sex); "mannish" or "passing" women, whose gender expression is masculine and who are often assumed to be lesbians, though this is not necessarily the case. Transsexual and transgenderist persons can be female-to-male (transsexual or transgendered men) as well as male-to-female (transsexual or transgendered women).</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The person attribute has values for BRWwriter, historical figure, writer, and IBRWriter. Use writer when creating documents for writers who are not British and/or female; use IBRWriter for writers who can be classified as British and International.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>This element does not allow prose. A sub-element must be chosen before prose is allowed. The personName element should be the first content element placed within a biography document.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>PersonName is a Div1 content element. It has the following sub-elements to capture specific names: birthname, professionalTitle, indexed, married, nickname, pseudonym, religiousName, royal, selfConstructed, styled, titled.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>

            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>All names with the exception of given and patroynm usually require separate dataItems. For example, use separate dataItems for her birthname and her married name or for any names that would not normally go together. There will, however, be instances when you want to include more than one element within one dataItem. For instance, it is logical to use the titled tag inside the same dataItem as married if, in fact, the name and title go together as parts of a single identity.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p></xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This has the advantage of appearing in the doc as Lady Gregory which is what she was called.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In most instances and where no discussion is required concerning names, one dataStruct can be used for all personName sub-elements.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Enter all names in first name-last name order. Do not invert the order. (i.e., &quot;Mary Wollstonecraft&quot; and not &quot;Wollstonecraft, Mary&quot;). This applies to all names entered in sub-elements inside personName.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>List names in the chronological order in which she received them. Standard practice dictates that birthname will be entered first.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For discussions about variant spellings, contested information or other discussions of scholarly disagreements concerning names, include a scholar&apos;s note inside the sub-element at issue. For explanation about the origin of a name or other content discussions, include in a shortprose element.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>All names must be entered within dataItems. Even if a discussion of the name is provided in shortprose include a dataItem with the name.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;personName&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;dataStruct&gt;&lt;dataItem&gt;&lt;nickname nameType=familiar&gt;Kitty&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;shortprose&gt;&lt;p&gt;KJ received her nickname Kitty from her sister, Nancy.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Do not put personName sub-elements inside a universal name element. Such tagging is redundant.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Use WroteOrPublishedAs attribute. All personName content sub-elements have an attribute for WroteOrPublishedAs to be used when the writer published under the name within the element.</xhtml:p>

Placing the identifying category elements around her religious denomination (&quot;Quaker&quot;), sexual identity (&quot;lesbian&quot;) or nationality (&quot;Scottish&quot;), for example, will point our end users toward writers whom they may be interested in researching if they were doing a project on any of these issues (for example, &quot;Contemporary Scottish women&apos;s writing&quot;). Placing a larger discussion within the general sub-elements (i.e., ClassIssue, Religion, etc.) will allow us to extract and merge all significant discussions of certain issues, providing our end users with a complex weave of information through which to analyse the construction of subjectivity.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Biography</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>CulturalFormation is a Div1 element that can be placed either around a general overview of her identity positions or can act as the bucket that holds the more specific elements of religion, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity, and nationality.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Relationships</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>CulturalFormation is a Div1 content element. It has two levels of sub-elements. The first set contains the following anchored sub-elements (to be placed around structural tags) which have their own subject specific sub-elements: classIssue, nationalityIssue, raceAndEthnicity, religion, sexuality. If no sub-element from the first set is selected, the following sub-elements are available (to be placed around the identifying word or phrase): raceColour, class, nationalHeritage, nationality, geogHeritage, ethnicity, denomination, language, politicalAffiliation, sexualIdentity.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;culturalFormation&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;shortProse&gt;&lt;p&gt;MH&apos;s family were &lt;nationality&gt;Scottish&lt;/&gt;. Her mother&apos;s family were &lt;denomination&gt;Quaker&lt;/&gt; on the maternal side, both soberly respectable and artistic. Her maternal grandfather was &lt;nationalHeritage FOREBEAR="grandfather"&gt;Scottish-Irish&lt;/&gt;, and committed to Home Rule. Her father&apos;s family were plain Scottish &lt;class&gt;working people&lt;/&gt;.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The above is an example of a summary culturalFormation statement which directly follows from the event of her birth.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;culturalFormation&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;shortProse&gt;&lt;p&gt;VB, perhaps defensively, staunchly proclaimed her &lt;sexualIdentity self-DEFINED="selfYes" &gt;heterosexuality&lt;/&gt; in the face of rumours of a lesbian relationship between her and Winifred Holtby. During her final illness, VB scribbled a note which read: &quot;I loved Winifred, but I was not in love with her.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The above is an example of a more specific discussion of her sexuality that requires the selection of the sexuality sub-element before going into the structural element.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>To the best of your ability, include a summary statement concerning her subject position following the chronology event of her birth. Do not separate this with a heading but try to have the prose flow out of her birth statement.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Do NOT enter all the information you have about her cultural formation subject position in the general overview statement at the beginning of your document. For a discussion of events in her life around these categories (for example, a religious conversion, her first lesbian sexual experience, etc.), open a culturalFormation element later in the document at the appropriate chronological place.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Use the specific sub-elements (classIssue, raceAndEthnicity, etc.) when you want to describe one area of particular pertinence to a woman&apos;s identity Where only a limited amount of information exists open the cultural formation element, open a Div 2, and then describe the jumble of identity issues in a ShortProse with any variety of inclusions. But where a particular issue like religion affected her life more than others, you can open Cultural formation, then open the subelement religion, for example, then open a Div 2; the short prose that follows will still contain inclusions but only those relating to religion, such as denomination.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>All information contained within this element, specifically the sub-elements directed towards identifying categories, apply to the person who is the subject of the biography. Do NOT use, for example, geogheritage to tag the fact that her employer was Carribean.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Biography</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Education is a Div1 element that can be used multiple times in one document. The element should be placed in chronological order based upon when the education took place. In most instances, this means education is placed directly following the first Family element containing initial information about the person&apos;s parents. In most instances, primary and university education will be included in the same element. But if, for example, she attended university after her marriage, multiple education elements should be used to include information at the chronologically appropriate place.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Relationships</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Education is a Div1 element that has content sub-elements of Award, Companion, Contested Behaviour, Degree, Instructor, School, Subject, Text. It has an optional attribute, Mode, used to register whether the education took place at home, in an institution or on her own. Though optional, this attribute should be used whenever you know what value to fill in.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>FriendsAssociates is a Div1 content element which should be placed in the appropriate chronological order within the biography document. Use multiple FriendsAssociates elements to record her friendships and associations in the proper chronological places in her biography. You can include both general summary statements of who she knew or only include a chronology event, for example, of her having dinner with a well-known literary figure. To the best of your ability, try to include a chronology event defining the initial meeting for most central and defining personal friendships.

            <xhtml:p>&lt;shortProse&lt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca West spent summers in the south of France with various friends, including &lt;Name&gt;John Van Druten&lt;/&gt;,&lt;Name&gt;Beverly Nichols&lt;/&gt;,&lt;Name&gt;G.B.

            <xhtml:p>All names captured in name tags within a friendsAssociates element are assumed to be either friends or associates of the subject of the biography. In the following example, tag Mary Hays but not Mary Wollstonecraft.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>She began a correspondence with &lt;name&gt;Mary Hays&lt;/&gt; (friend of fellow Jacobin feminist, Mary Wollstonecraft).</xhtml:p>
            <!-- KJB: Query: not yet decided. -->
            <xhtml:p>Any significant associations with her publishers are not to be included under friendsAssociates. Relations with her publisher are better captured within the Writing DTD where you can specify whether the relationship was predominantly personal or professional.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Her friendships and connections with other writers should be noted within friendsAssociates. If these relations involved her literary influence on the other writer or the writer&apos;s literary or artistic influence on her, discussion of this should be included in her writing document.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If a BWW is friends or associates with another British woman writer who also has biography and writing documents, we will want to create hypertext links between the two documents. For now, record our desire for such a link by writing LINK in a research note nearby the name of the second woman writer.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Troubleshooting</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Question: Charlotte Smith had a longtime relationship with her publisher. Does it go in her biography document as a friendsAssociates?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: This will involve a judgement call concerning the extent of her relationship. Because Smith&apos;s connection with her publisher was a significant personal relationship, include a mention of it in her biography in order to capture it under this element, but include the full discussion of the relationship within her writing document.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: Should friendships with other writers be included under friendsAssociates?</xhtml:p>
            <!-- EH was an early correspondent of G.B.Shaw, suggesting to him that he should write plays, while he in turn encouraged her writing. -->
            <xhtml:p>Answer: This will involve a judgement call. Since the focus of our project is writing, we are emphasizing how these relationships effected her writing and not her life. In most instances where a direct influence is at issue, discussion of the relationship will be captured within her writing document. Mention her connection with Shaw in friendsAssociates but include a discussion of their mutual influence for her writing document.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: Should Vera Brittain and Wininfred Holtby's relationship be under friendsAssociates or intimateRelationships?</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Biography</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>IntimateRelationships is a Div1 content element which should be placed in the appropriate chronological order within the biography document. Use multiple intimateRelationships elements to record her intimate relationships in the proper chronological places in her biography. Generally, you will use this element in a shortProse, but where possible and where sensible, use a chronStruct to signify the initial meeting or a significant event in the relationship; in this way, the importance of the intimate relationships will be represented in the chronology of her life. Often you will not be able to date the beginning of the relationship.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Relationships</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>IntimateRelationships is a Div1 content element which has sub-elements of livesWith and sexualIdentity. It has an optional attribute of erotic.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;intimateRelationships erotic=eroticPossibly&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;chronstruct&gt;&lt;date&gt;1941&lt;/&gt; &lt;chronprose&gt;&lt;livesWith&gt;After leaving her husband, Rose Allatini went to live in Sussex with &lt;name&gt;Melanie Mills&lt;/&gt;, a writer who published, like Rose Allatini, under various pseudonyms.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;shortprose&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is possible that theirs was a &lt;sexualIdentiy self-DEFINED=&quot;selfUnknown&quot;&gt;lesbian&lt;/&gt; relationship, although nothing definite is known.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;intimateRelationships&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;shortProse&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;name&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/&gt;, a Canadian hunter whom Isabella Bird met in Hawaii, proposed to her, but she rejected his offer. &lt;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;She later met &lt;name&gt;Jim Nugent&lt;/&gt;, a mountain guide, when she was travelling in the Rockies, and the two became attracted to each other. Fond as she was of him, she rejected him when he professed his feelings for her. Jim Nugent was a desperado and had a drinking problem, though he also had a compassionate and gentle side according to Bird. Six months after Bird returned home, he was shot dead in a fight in the mountains.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>All names tagged within an intimateRelationships element will be assumed to the names of people with whom she was intimate. In example below from Radcylffe Hall's biography, do not tag Ernest Troubridge because it was Una Troubridge and not Hall who had the intimate relationship with Ernest.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;intimateRelationships&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;shortProse&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;name&gt;Una Troubridge&lt;/&gt; married Ernest Troubridge, who would become an admiral by the end of World War 1, on 10 October 1908. He was forty-four when they married.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Generally, you will be using shortProse to discuss intimateRelationships because the beginnings of these relationships are frequently undatable in the way that legally or socially sanctioned relationships might be (making them unamenable to chronStructs). Of course, use chronStructs if you can and if it makes sense.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Question: Should Vera Brittain and Winifred Holtby's relationship be under friendsAssociates or intimateRelationships?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: IntimateRelationships. While biographers speculate on whether the two had a sexual relationship, it is clear that they were emotionally and materially intimate. Placing their relationship inside a friendsAssociates tag denies the significance of relationships that do not fit into traditional categories of marriage and/or lovers.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: What about if she was sexually intimate with a person for a very brief period, perhaps only one night, and was never emotionally, personally or materially involved?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: IntimateRelationships is still the place that we gather information about her sexual life. If this is the case, check off the &quot;eroticYes&quot; attribute value and describe the brief nature of the relationship in the prose.</xhtml:p>

                    <xhtml:p>Answer: Use your judgement about an acceptable level of assumption. While we do not want to assume that just because people lived together or were married that they had an erotic relation, we can reasonably gather from biographical information whether the pretence was erotic and therefore sexuality was an issue in the relationship.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>&lt;occupation&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;ShortProse&gt;&lt;p&gt;PD.A. Thomas invited his daughter, MHR to work as his &lt;job FAMILYBUSINESS=&quot;FamilyBusinessYes&quot;&gt; personal assistant&lt;/&gt; in &lt;DATE&gt;1914&lt;/&gt; at &lt;Remuneration&gt;¥1000 per year&lt;/&gt;. She was so successful that by mid-1914, he turned over the &lt;orgName&gt;Thomas newspaper&lt;/&gt; interests to her.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;Occupation&gt;&lt;Div2&gt;&lt;shortprose&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with her husband, AA became a&lt;&gt; preacher&lt;/&gt; after converting to Quakerism</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In the above example, her preaching in entered under occupation in order to capture preaching as an occupation of women, particularly early women writers. However, her conversion and her status as a Quaker are also crucial information to our critical history and must be included inside a Religion element.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>All work associated with writing (for example, editing, review writing, playwriting, journalism, etc.) does not go under occupation. Do not include here. We assume that all British Women Writers were writers first and foremost and all information about her career as a writer belongs in her Writing document. Only include editing or journalism work, for example, if it clearly was her day job and had nothing to do with her writing. Do Not Include: GA was poetry editor of City Limits.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>All jobs and significant activities tagged inside occupation are assumed to be the activities of the subject of the biography. Do not insert an occupation- job tag around, for example, her brother's job in the following &quot;While her brother was a doctor, her family did not support female doctors and, instead, she became a nurse.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If a person was employed by a university, the university is tagged as an employer and an orgName inside occupation. If she went to the university as a student, then the university is tagged as a school inside education.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>MS was a teacher at &lt;employer&gt; &lt;orgName&gt;Manchester University&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Troubleshooting</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Question: If a woman writer worked for a pro-choice organization and was paid for her work, should this be included under occupation or politics?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: You will often find yourself making such judgement calls and the answer will depend on the context. But if she, herself, was pro-choice then the activity should be included under Politics. If your document flow allows, you may wish to include this information in different ways in two elements.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: If a woman writer wrote reviews for magazines, do I include this under occupation?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: No. All work associated with her writing career is included in her Writing document.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: How would I tag information that Selina Bunbury kept house for her brother? Under a family or occupation element?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: Occupation. Since we are interested in tracking women&apos;s unpaid domestic work, being able to capture this information as a significant activity is worth going out of a family element to insert an occupation element.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Question: If a woman writer taught at a school, do I include it under education to put a school tag around the name of the school?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: No. If a school was her employer, include under occupation and tag the school as an employer and an organization.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Suffrage is a common political activity and since the term suffrage is used in the above example, it can be tagged as a political affiliation.

Given the current attitudes to marriage and domestic violence in the village, FT knew that the police would likely be unsympathetic and unwilling to interfere in domestic strife but felt that she bore some portion of the blame for Emily's death by having said nothing.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Consider using a keywordClass. Because of the weakness of an &quot;other&quot; category to structure information, using a keywordClass may help to link this event with similar events in other biographical documents. Keywords should be used with discretion and only with direction from a volume author or a post doc.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Avoid using this element and if you find yourself using it often, you are probably missing other important elements. It has been used in the past (incorrectly) to cover such issues as finances or illnesses (which have other elements specifically addressing those topics). It has been incorrectly used to cover the life events of those related to the BWW. Don't do this.</xhtml:p>

It captures information and discussions of a person&apos;s subject position with regards to race and ethnicity by working in conjunction with subject specific sub-elements (raceColour, nationalHeritage, geogHeritage, ethnicity). The following discussion applies to both the general discursive discussion of raceAndEthnicity as well as the specific sub-element categories. Despite the anxieties of the ways in which categories of race or ethnicity circulate and serve various kinds of undesirable interests, to ignore or go the totally free-text route is not a responsible solution for this project, though it would certainly be easier and simpler. The trick here is to make the complexities of the question of race and ethnicity emerge, and to make it clear that these are shifting, historically constituted, and interestedly deployed categories whose use must be understood contextually. The discursiveness with which we will present these categories will, hopefully, help to do this and also allay the anxiety we feel about &quot;labelling&quot; in a vacuum. In other words, the project has no notion that we could or should come up with what is in any way an exact, fully defined, or mutually exclusive set of categories: the point is the overlap within them. Within this system, counting per se becomes highly problematic and the user has to do some work (and some thinking/active defining) before arriving at any kind of list or count, and will hopefully arrive at it with a sense of how problematic such an activity is. We want, as we go, to build carefully sets of associations for either the thesaurus or a specialized search function, gradually building a set of lists, eventually with fleshed-out definitions, to become glossary items attached to the terms that are hard to understand. People tagging will use what terms seem to them to be right for the context, tagging with the category or categories within which they seem to fit, but they should be encouraged not to let race/ethnicity become invisible or only an issue in relation to the marginalized. If we think it will look silly if there is a statement in entry after entry on British women writers saying that she was (presumably) white, I think that&apos;s an indication of the force of biographical conventions and we should not let them dictate our practices. And we should, as stressed by those concerned about &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; as homogenizing categories, encourage people to reach for specificity through multiplicity: i.e. generally attempt to include at least two of: &quot;race/colour&quot;; &quot;ethnicity&quot;; &quot;nationality&quot; or &quot;national-heritage.&quot; Beginning with the list started by the race-ethnicity subgroup, we have devised a structured vocabulary for these tags, though the lists need not be mutually exclusive or even internally consistent.

            <xhtml:h3>Relationships</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>RaceAndEthnicity is a sub-element within culturalFormation. It has four realted content sub-elements: raceColour, nationalHeritage, geogHeritage, and ethnicity. You are also able to access all of the other subelements appropriate to the discussion of cultural formation: class, denomination, language, nationality, politicalAffiliation, and sexualIdentity.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Anna Leonowens: &lt;raceAndEthnicity&gt; Although Leonowens herself, in attempting to adopt an unequivocally &lt;nationality self-IDENTIFIED=&quot;SelfYes&quot;&gt;English&lt;/&gt; identity, implicitly claimed that she was &lt;raceColour self-IDENTIFIED=&quot;SelfYes&quot;&gt;white&lt;/&gt;, there is evidence to suggest that although her father was &lt;national-heritage FOREBEAR=&quot;father&quot;&gt; Welsh&lt;/&gt; and presumably &lt;race/colour&lt;forebear&gt;= &quot;father&quot;&gt;white&lt;/&gt;, her mother was quite possibly &lt;race/colour &lt;FOREBEAR=&quot;mother&quot;&gt; Eurasian.&lt;/&gt; &lt;bibcit&gt;Bristowe 23-31&lt;\bibcit&gt;&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Glossary item: Eurasian: &quot;A term used in the during the Victorian period, in the context of the British colonization of India, to connote a mixture of white, European and Asiatic, usually East Indian parentage.&lt;bibcit&gt; OED&lt;\bibcit&gt;&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Thesaurus/search engine should include link between &quot;Eurasian&quot; and &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot; and should include &quot;Eurasian&quot; in results for searches on word &quot;Indian,&quot; and &quot;Welsh&quot; in searches under &quot;British.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Pauline Johnson:&lt;race/ethnicity&gt; Pauline Johnson was born to a &lt;race/colour FOREBEAR=&quot;mother&quot;&lt;white, &lt;/&gt; &lt;national-heritage FOREBEAR=&quot;mother&quot;&gt; English&lt;/&gt; mother and a &lt;national-heritage FOREBEAR=&quot;father&quot;&gt; Mohawk&lt;/&gt; father.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>I consider the omission of &quot;race/colour&quot; for her father justifiable, because although we don&apos;t want to assume that &quot;English&quot; connotes &quot;white,&quot; it would be a very unusual case for someone &quot;white&quot; to belong to the Mohawk nation, although one such case was cited on the student list.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Thesaurus/search engine should include &quot;Mohawk&quot; in results for searches on &quot;North-American Indian,&quot; (a category I doubt we will be using), &lt;ethnicity&gt;Native North American, &lt;nation-heritage&gt;&quot;First nation,&quot; etc., as well as in searches on &lt;race/colour&gt; &quot;North-American aboriginal.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Ama Ata Aidoo: &lt;race/ethnicity&gt; Born near Dominaise, &lt;national-heritage&gt; Ghana,&lt;/&gt; Aidoo now lives in Zimbabwe and writes that the problems of &lt;race/colour&gt; black &lt;/&gt; African women are &quot;integral parts of the problems of colonial and postcolonial Africa.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Ghana linked to &lt;geog&gt; Africa for search purposes. I think in Aidoo&apos;s case the material related to travel and experiences of racism would be included in education, location, occupation, etc.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Grace Aguilar: &lt;race/ethnicity&gt; Both of Aguilar's parents were presumably &lt;race/colour FOREBEAR=&quot;parents&quot;&gt;white&lt;/&gt; and of &lt;national-heritage&gt; Spanish-&lt;/&gt; &lt;race/colour FOREBEAR=&quot;parents&quot;&gt;Jewish&lt;/&gt; descent. &lt;nationality&gt; English&lt;/&gt; by birth, she identified strongly with her &lt;race/colour selfDefined=selfYes&gt; Jewish&lt;/&gt; heritage.&lt;/&gt;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>I've designated Jewish here as racial because of the way it was viewed in the nineteenth-century, including, I suspect, by Aguilar herself, although this would be changed if research on her suggested otherwise. The search engine/thesaurus would bring together &lt;race\colour&gt; Jewish and &lt;ethnicity&gt; Jewish to make the slippage between the two visible.</xhtml:p>

Whiteness should also be named in the cases of colonial women travellers and everyone else from after World War II when a sizeable resident non-white population re-established itself in Britain. To do this, we ask that you open an empty raceColour element (if not already used in the prose) and regularize the attribute to &quot;white.&quot;</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Nationality is a sub-element available within culturalFormation and nationalityIssue. It has optional attributes for currentAlternativeTerm, and self-defined. Another optional attribute is Reg, which allows you to express the nationality in a standard form when you have been unable to do so in your prose.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Within Nationality, you are able to access all of the other subelements appropriate to the discussion of cultural formation: class, denomination, ethnicity, geogheritage, language, nationalHeritage, nationality, politicalAffiliation, raceColour, and sexualIdentity.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>She was born in&lt;nationality reg=Welsh&gt;Cardiff&lt;/&gt;, but later moved to Ireland.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>&lt;nationality&gt;Irish&lt;/&gt; by birth, KL moved to London in her later life.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>PJB was a &lt;nationality&gt;Scottish&lt;/&gt;writer, and her later work reveals a Unitarian bent.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Use Irish, Scottish, Welsh, English wherever possible. To the best of your ability, include a British woman writer&apos;s specific nationality in order to allow us to sub-divide writers into these categories.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Do not use the term &quot;British&quot; for anyone prior to 1707 which is the date of the Union of England and Scotland.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Use of this element assumes that the nationality tagged applies to the subject of the biography. Do NOT use for the nationality of her parent&apos;s unless it was also her nationality. If it was not, then tag her parent&apos;s nationality as nationalHeritage.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Including a brief cultural formation element following the chronology event giving the date and place of her birth, allows the researcher to rephrase the information already given in birth. For example, after including &quot;Dublin&quot; as the place of her birth, the researcher should consider including a statement such as &quot;Irish by birth, her family was working-class.&quot;</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Question: If she was born in Scotland and then moved to London at the age of 20, do I put in another nationality element?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: It depends on the context of the writer&apos;s life. Certainly note the Scottish origins if there is any indication of the author&apos;s interest in her Scottish identity. If she clearly thought of herself as English even though she was Scottish, you might want to tag her Scottish nationality with the attribute SELFDEFINED=&quot;selfNo&quot; and her English nationality as SELFDEFINED=&quot;selfYes.&quot;</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>PoliticalAffiliation is a sub-element within Politics and cultural Formation. It has optional attributes of activism, involvement, membership, woman-genderIssue that record the type of affiliation described. Another optional attribute, Reg, allows you to express the political affiliation in a standard way if you have been unable to do in your prose.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Examples</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>1910: RS became a &lt;politicalAffiliation&gt;suffrage&lt;/&gt; supporter.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Suffrage is a common political activity and since the term suffrage is used in the above example, it can be tagged as a political affiliation. If the term is not used, include an enply politicalAffiliation element and capture this information in the reg attribute. Try to include a political affiliation sub-element in all politics elements.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h3>Practice Issues</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Tag all organized political parties and organizations with orgName (for example, Labour Party, PEN). Tagging an orgName within politics does not denote that the person supported this organization. She may have protested vehemently against the Tory Party but Tory Party is given an orgName element. If she was a full supporter of the Tory Party, in addition to orgName, this should be tagged as a politicalAffiliation.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Try to use the attributes to specify the type of affiliation but leave blank if unknown or if they do not apply.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>To the best of your ability, try to construct a sentence which allows you to put a politicalAffiliation tag around a word or short phrase. Instead of writing &quot;She protested against the Darlington nuclear facility&quot;, use &quot;Her anti-nuclear position informed her protest against the Darlington nuclear facility&quot;, placing the tag around &quot;anti-nuclear.&quot;</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Troubleshooting</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Question: When all you know about a woman writer is that she wrote radical feminist and working-class plays, how do you tag her political affiliation?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: Discussion of political involvement will often involve making judgement calls. While critical discussion of the politics of her plays, will be included in her writing document, think about using a phrase like &quot;Although we have no knowledge of her activism, her work demonstrates an support for radical feminist and working-class issues.&quot;</xhtml:p>

Placing this desire in this tag does not signify that you are identifying her as a lesbian but that someone interested in the issue of lesbianism, could find this experience.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>You should use the tag in combination with the element OrgName when the school is fairly well known. Do not worry about using OrgName if the school is fairly obscure.

            <xhtml:p>Often all we know is that a woman writer had five children; therefore, there is no information to include within a specific member sub-element. However, we do not want to lose the information that she was a mother and we capture it by including the general comment and placing this tag around the fact that she had five children. If a woman had three children from her first marriage and two from her second, we want to capture the TOTAL number of children she had. This means that the number attribute on one of the children elements would read &quot;5.&quot; While the number attribute is optional, in almost all cases it should be filled out.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Do not include a discussion of a specific child within this element. Open a member=child sub-element.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Using this sub-element does not denote that the relationship was sexual but signifies material living arrangements. She could have lived with a person as a roomate or the person could be her life long companion. Using livesWith within IntimateRelationships also does not denote that the relationship was sexual but suggests that the living arrangements were more significant than simple roomates.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Do not put the tag only around phrases such as &quot;with whom she lived&quot; but include enough prose to describe the living arrangement.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:h3>Troubleshooting</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>Question: If a woman writer lived with another woman writer, regardless of whether they were acquaintances, lovers, or intimate relations, can I use the "&quot;lives with&quot; tag or is it reserved only for intimate relationships?</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Answer: Yes. Regardless of whether they were enemies or lovers, if they lived together, they get a livesWith element. This element is available within both intimateRelationships and FriendsAssociates to allow for a variety of living arrangements.</xhtml:p>

                <xhtml:p>Do not use the cryptic attribute to refer to familial nicknames. For example, Sarah Scott was referred to within her family as &quot;Pea&quot; but because it does not pertain to her publishing life, the name is best discussed in nickNames. The term should be reserved for pseudonymous names used in publishing.</xhtml:p>
                <xhtml:p>There are cases where a personal name can take the cryptic attribute. For example, when Henrietta Battier called herself &quot;Patt. Pindar&quot;, &quot;Pat. T.Pindar&quot; and similar, it was not that she was pretending to be called Pat, but with a double allusion - she was implying she was a spiritual sister of the famous satirist John Wolcot, who wrote as &quot;Peter Pindar&quot; (which is in itself an allusion to the ancient poet Pindar). She&apos;s concealing &quot;Battier&quot; in a claim of relationship to the famous satirist. If this is the case, use the crytpic attribute but please explain in a scholar&apos;s note the nature and meaning of the name for future readers.</xhtml:p>

                <xhtml:p>Question: Rebecca West&apos;s husband refered to her romantically and affectionally as &quot;Rac.&quot; Is this a romance name?</xhtml:p>
                <xhtml:p>Answer: No. Romance applies to a specific type of name used in romance writing.</xhtml:p>
